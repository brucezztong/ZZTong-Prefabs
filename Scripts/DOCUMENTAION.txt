teragon-scount.py
-----------------

Usage: ./teragon-scout.py
Results: Teragon/ZZTong-Prefabs-Property-List.txt

The script builds a prefab property list (data file) appropriate for use with
Teragon. The script builds the data file based on the contents of the XML
files for each POI, Part, or Tile found in the modlet.


validate-modlet.py
------------------

Usage: ./validate-modlet.py
Results: Prints a list of missing POI, Part, Tile, and Decoration files.

This script is a handy check to run prior to a release as it will tell you if
you are missing mesh files, or whatever you might have forgotten to generate
for a new POI, Part, Tile, or Decoration.


zz2cp.py
--------

Usage: ./zz2cp.py
Results: A directory called CP-Export with renamed Prefabs and Config files.

This script is intended to make it easier to submit a bunch of changes to the
CompoPack. It saves the CP folks time in that they do not need to spend a
bunch of their time renaming my files.
