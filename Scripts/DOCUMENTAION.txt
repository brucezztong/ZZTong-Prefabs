poi-scout.py
------------

Usage: ./poi-scout.py [directory]
Example: ./poi-scout.py ../Prefabs/POIs/
Results: A list of all blocks found in all POIs will be produced.

The script examines all POI files in a directory and compiles a list of block
names and a count of how many blocks of those types are in each POI. This is a
handy tool for finding blocks that TFP has discontinued or figuring out which
POIs contain custom blocks.


tag-report.py
-------------

Usage: ./tag-report.py [directory]
Example: ./tag-report.py ../Prefabs/POIs/
Results: Lists the tags for each POI

This utility was written to help Stallionsden look for issues in the CompoPack
but it is handy for all sorts of reasons.


teragon-scout.py
-----------------

Usage: ./teragon-scout.py
Results: Teragon/ZZTong-Prefabs-Property-List.txt

The script builds a prefab property list (data file) appropriate for use with
Teragon. The script builds the data file based on the contents of the XML
files for each POI, Part, or Tile found in the modlet.


validate-modlet.py
------------------

Usage: ./validate-modlet.py
Results: Prints a list of missing POI, Part, Tile, and Decoration files.

This script is a handy check to run prior to a release as it will tell you if
you are missing mesh files, or whatever you might have forgotten to generate
for a new POI, Part, Tile, or Decoration.


zombie-analysis.py
------------------

Usage: ./zombie-analysis.py [directory]
Example: ./zombie-analysis.py ../Prefabs/POIs/
Results: Tells you the number of zombie volumes and range of zombies.

This is a handy script for making a CSV that will show zombie volume densities
to compare for matching up the zombie challenge with the POI tier.


zz2cp.py
--------

Usage: ./zz2cp.py
Results: A directory called CP-Export with renamed Prefabs and Config files.

This script is intended to make it easier to submit a bunch of changes to the
CompoPack. It saves the CP folks time in that they do not need to spend a
bunch of their time renaming my files.
