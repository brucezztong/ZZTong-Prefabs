If you have questions about the GPLv3 you should seek advice available on the
web. This document will attempt to answer some common questions.

Q: Do I have to release my changes to your modlet?
A: No. The GPL does not require you to release a modified version of this
modlet or any derivitive works made from the POIs. Do what you want with the
content for your own private amusement. If, however, you decide to release
some or all of this modlet or the POIs within, including derivitive works,
then you cannot constrain others from the files necessary to make derivitive
works.

Q: Do I have to notify you before I distribute my changes?
A: No, The GPL does not require you to notify me for you to use it or
redistribute some or all of this modlet or its POIs. However, I like knowing
when people do. (It makes me feel good.) Notifying me gives me the opportunity
to learn about your project and perhaps pass along suggestions. For the price
of an email, maybe you could make me happy... zztong@gmail.com

Q: Why bother with a license? Isn't "public domain" good enough?
A: Sure, 99/100 times public domain is good enough. But when civility ends,
the law begins.

COMPOPACK

I don't believe the GPLv3 prohibits the CompoPack in any way. That is, I
recognize the CompoPack needs to make derivitive works in order to maintain
the consistency and integrity of the CompoPack. Derivitive works of my POIs
are fine, so long as they're still bound by the GPLv3. The CompoPack as I
know it seems to be well within the spirit of the matter.

CURATED MODLETS

I don't believe the GPLv3 prohibits my POIs from appearing in "Curated Modlets"
in any way. By that, I mean if you want to make a modlet for your server to
distribute to your users that should be fine. Similarly, if you want to make a
"Top 100 POIs" modlet, that should be fine too. (I would be flattered to be
among them.) Redistribution is fine so long as my POIs are still bound by
the GPLv3.

OVERHAUL MODS

I don't believe the GPLv3 prohibits Overhaul Mods from making derivitive works
of these POIs or from distributing those works, so long as these POIs are still
bound by the GPLv3.

Overhaul Mods like to introduce new code and artistic works. I don't believe
any code or artistic works related to custom blocks is encumbered by this
license because those work products are not part of these POIs or derivitives
of these POIs. That is, derivitive POIs my have references to the code and
artistic works that embody a custom block but those references do not represent
a claim of any type over the code or artistic works that define the custom
blocks. Similarly, the POIs do not claim any rights over the block definitions
that clearly belong to The Fun Pimps and are distributed with the 7 Days to Die
game. That is to say, a POI is just an expression of how blocks should be
arranged and displayed, not the underlying blocks themselves.
