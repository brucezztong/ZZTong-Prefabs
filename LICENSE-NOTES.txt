If you have questions about the GPLv3 you should seek advice available on the
web. This document will attempt to answer some common questions.

Q: Do I have to release my changes to your modlet?
A: No. The GPL does not require you to release a modified version of this
modlet or any derivitive works made from the POIs. Do what you want with the
content for your own private amusement. If, however, you decide to release
some or all of this modlet or the POIs within, including derivitive works,
then you cannot constrain others from the files necessary to make derivitive
works.

Q: Do I have to notify you before I distribute my changes?
A: No, The GPL does not require you to notify me for you to use it or
redistribute some or all of this modlet or its POIs. However, I like knowing
when people do. (It makes me feel good.) Notifying me gives me the opportunity
to learn about your project and perhaps pass along suggestions. For the price
of an email, maybe you could make me happy... zztong@gmail.com

Q: Why bother with a license? Isn't "public domain" good enough?
A: Sure, 99/100 times public domain is good enough. But when civility ends,
the law begins.

COMPOPACK

I don't believe the GPLv3 prohibits the CompoPack in any way. That is, I
recognize the CompoPack needs to make derivitive works in order to maintain
the consistency and integrity of the CompoPack. Derivitive works of my POIs
are fine, so long as they're still bound by the GPLv3. The CompoPack as I
know it seems to be well within the spirit of the matter.

CURATED MODLETS

I don't believe the GPLv3 prohibits my POIs from appearing in "Curated Modlets"
in any way. By that, I mean if you want to make a modlet for your server to
distribute to your users that should be fine. Similarly, if you want to make a
"Top 100 POIs" modlet, that should be fine too. (I would be flattered to be
among them.) Redistribution is fine so long as my POIs are still bound by
the GPLv3.

OVERHAUL MODS

I don't believe the GPLv3 prohibits Overhaul Mods from making derivitive works
of these POIs or from distributing those works, so long as these POIs are still
bound by the GPLv3.

Overhaul Mods like to introduce new code and artistic works. I don't believe
any code or artistic works related to custom blocks is encumbered by this
license because those work products are not part of these POIs or derivitives
of these POIs. That is, derivitive POIs my have references to the code and
artistic works that embody a custom block but those references do not represent
a claim of any type over the code or artistic works that define the custom
blocks. Similarly, the POIs do not claim any rights over the block definitions
that clearly belong to The Fun Pimps and are distributed with the 7 Days to Die
game. That is to say, a POI is just an expression of how blocks should be
arranged and displayed, not the underlying blocks themselves.

THE FUN PIMPS

The license for the game 7 Days to Die ensures The Fun Pimps can do pretty much
anything they want to with my POIs. Quoting from their license:

"The Software may allow you to create content, including but not limited to a
gameplay map, screenshot or a video of your game play. In exchange for use of
the Software, and to the extent that your contributions through use of the
Software give rise to any copyright interest, you hereby grant Licensor an
exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, fully transferable and sub-licensable
worldwide right and license to use your contributions in any way and for any
purpose in connection with the Software and related goods and services,
including the rights to reproduce, copy, adapt, modify, perform, display,
publish, broadcast, transmit, or otherwise communicate to the public by any
means whether now known or unknown and distribute your contributions without
any further notice or compensation to you of any kind for the whole duration of
protection granted to intellectual property rights by applicable laws and
international conventions. You hereby waive any moral rights of paternity,
publication, reputation, or attribution with respect to Licensor’s and other
players’ use and enjoyment of such assets in connection with the Software and
related goods and services under applicable law. This license grant to
Licensor, and the above waiver of any applicable moral rights, survives any
termination of this License."

This seems fair to me, especially since some of my POIs are derivitive works
of theirs. Since the relationship is going to be this close, it might as well
be incestuous.
