* New Hidden Decorations and POIs thanks to ideas from the Rebirth community:
    buried_treasure_01 (Deco), buried_treasure_02 (POI)
* Retired the old, huge, ugly, wasteful Office_Bldg_03.
* Added a new Office_Bldg_03, lighter, nastier, nicer looking.

A21.2.020 (ZZ020)
* Fixed installation instructions.
* Fixed biomes.xml issues with decorations.

A21.2.019 (ZZ019)

* Added rwg_tile_gateway_intersection_zztong_01.
* Added rwg_tile_gateway_intersection_zztong_02.
* Added rwg_tile_gateway_intersection_zztong_03.
* Added bartertown_bobx, bartertown_hughx, bartertown_jenx,
    bartertown_joelx, bartertown_rektx.
* Added pump_substation_01, solar_farm_02.
* Changed the DifficultyTier for all Tiles to 0 to assist modders.
* Removed QuestTags from things that shouldn't have quest tags.

A21.2.018 (ZZ018)
* Bug fixes
* Added restaurant_03, warehouse_04, store_s_03, store_s_04, store_xs_16,
    store_s_05, gyroport_01, tfp_docks_01, tfp_docks_05, lot_vacant_03,
    lot_vacant_04, lot_vacant_05, lot_vacant_06, storage_02, trailer_02,
    trailer_park_04.
* Added rwg_tile_gateway_straight_zztong_07, rwg_tile_gateway_t_zztong_02,
    rwg_tile_countryresidential_corner_zztong_01,
    rwg_tile_countryresidential_corner_02, rwg_tile_countryresidential_t_01.
* More infestation quests.

A21.1.017 (ZZ017)
* Updated Teragon configuration file to match newest format.
* Adjustments to POIs based on user feedback.
* Revised rwg_tile_downtown_intersection_zztong_01 to improve performance.
    Adjustments made to the four intersection POIs to match.
* Used DuplicateRepeatDistance to moderate the placement of house and
    wilderness POIs. I'm not trying to take over the world. Honest!
* Smoothed the terrain on many Tiles.
* Moved Quest (qt_zztong) to another modlet. This kind of thing has started
    to look like scope creep and is better off elsewhere.

A21.1.016 (ZZ016)
* Added tfp_apartment_adobe_01, tfp_prison_01, tfp_school_k6_01, and
    tfp_settlement_01 because some folks were feeling nostalgic.
    Okay, yes, I was feeling nostalgic too.
* Added restaurant_02 -- Waffle House was suggested by Max_Dong and I'm a fan
    of the restaurant, so yeh... there it is.
* Added rwg_tile_gateway_straight_zztong_04 with a variety of bridge parts.
* Added rwg_tile_gateway_straight_zztong_05.
* Added rwg_tile_gateway_straight_zztong_06.
* Have begun to add Infestation Quests to POIs.
* Am dabbling with the use of Triggers, but am mindful of the great many user
    complaints about the use of this feature in A21 vanilla POIs with regard
    to zombies appearing out of thin air and the affects on stealth. As a
    stealth player myself, I do appreciate being able to disarm an ambush if I
    play well.
* Removed settlement modifications from rwgmixer.xml with respect to what
    districts are used to wrap towns and cities. In retrospect, those options
    are probably better off in a map/RWG focused modlet. Now this modlet only
    contains configuration that support the placement of the modlet's POIs.
* In response to player feedback, the placement of dogs on Tiles and in Tier 1
    POIs has been revisited and those dogs have mostly been either muzzled or
    removed. In the cases where they stayed, there was generally a reason why
    they were there, but I did lower the chance of the dog appearing. If you
    choose to wander through a higher tier POI as a shortcut then you can still
    encounter the beasties.
* Added Trader variants for those who want to play without trader POIs.
    This is NOT configured by default so if you want to play this way, see the
    README file for instructions.

A21.0.015 (ZZ015):
* Updated to A21 Blocks.
* Migrated all custom blocks to the "Custom Blocks Pack" modlet.
    This modlet now depends upon that modlet. You need to install them both.
* Worked to eliminate custom Parts that only had one block. The strategy going
    forward is to use Parts for collections of blocks.
* Broke the README file into README and CHANGELOG.
* Added a Documentation folder to hold misc TXT files.
* Broke up the kludge that was the A20 Gateway Tile resulting in new POIs:
    adot_01, containers_01, car_show_01, fieldday_01, ranger_hq_01, scout_lodge_01,
    storage_01, roadside_rest_01, trailer_park_03, truck_park_01, truck_stop_01,
    gateway_filler_01, gateway_filler_02, gateway_filler_03.
* Added wind_turbine_02 as a standard POI marker size for non-wilderness.
* Added rwg_tile_gateway_straight_zztong_01, rwg_tile_gateway_straight_zztong_02,
    and rwg_tile_gateway_straight_zztong_03.
* Added skyscraper_01 and tfp_skyscraper_02 to the commercial district to take
    some heat off of the downtown district. (They can now be in either.)
    This also addresses player desires for more Tier 5 POIs on maps.
* Removed all Destroyed POIs from the modlet. You can find them in the
    CompoPack where they may appear in the CP's destroyed city.
* Reviewed all Parts and sent many to my Archive in favor of making and using
    Placeholder blocks from this point on. I'll largely move away from Parts
    that consist of 1 block.
* Added a variety of "Notes" to the loot which add local color to the game.
    Among them there are four coded fragments that can be assembled and sold.
* Added a "Bruce's Treasure" quest to the game for no particular reason.

cleaning up texture issues, loot issues, and lots of reasons.

Added POI names to the Localization.txt file in preparation for A21.
Added some more custom blocks and helpers to provide more crate options.
Removed the subway system from the Intersection Tile and all related POIs
because it was leading people down a path to fail missions and because Arizona

Lowered the following to Tier 2: ems_01 and Zeds were thinned out.
Lowered the following to Tier 3: office_building_01. Boy-o-boy there were too
many Zeds crammed into that building trying to hit that higher tier.

Storm Cellar Parts that had some weird layer of stone inserted in them.

Re-rebalanced loot in Tier 5's because I really screwed those up.
Re-rebalanced loot in Masonry_01 and Cement_Plant_01. Still too much cement.

Spinkled Parts into many existing POIs for some subtle variety.
A couple of POIs changed tiers. Added decorations for the Wasteland.

Introduced this modlet to GitHub for my own sanity and peace of mind.
This should have no effect on modlet distribution, but may open up options for
those who work on other projects, plus it gives me a nice backup location.
I do NOT recommend consumers of this modlet pull from the head of main branch.

Introduced this modlet to the GPLv3 license. See LICENSE.TXT and the
LICENSE-NOTES.txt files for details. It should not represent a significant
